Implemented triggers, a function to quickly create sequences of spikes and provided a fix to 
	the "floating space above platforms" problem.
Changes were made to the constructor of the spikes, platforms, and trigger classes, see Level01 subclass
	in the code for examples.


Notes:  Triggers only trigger moving platforms and other triggers.
	Added a placeholder background, but it creates immense lag so that section was commented out, 
		it can be found under the draw function of the Level superclass. 
	In fixing the platforms I introduced a bug that I did not debug, in which if you fall beyond 
		the screen the character floats there and loses the correct proportions, the character 
		can be reset by jumping.
	Blitting images with offset allows the image to be grabbed starting from offset, thus allowing
		for extra empty space in images to be ignored.
	The level end check was not implemented.
	Carlo's nor Kristina's code has been full merged into this version.

I Copied this log over here and created a main file where we should all merge our versions.
I have already merged my part and used Baldo's file as the base.
