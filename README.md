# Peppermint Knightmare
Authors: Carlos Algarra, Baldo Mendez, Kristina Garcia.
Peppermint Knightmare is a platformer game created using the PyGame library for Python.
There is only 1 level programmed into the game and was designed to be hard to beat, as it requires very precise jumps. (We were inspired in IAmTheBoshy 
games). The file testenv.py is the main file.

Future changes: Add world editor and create more levels.
